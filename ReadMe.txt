How To Run


Must follow in this order for now:

- Open host, user1, and user2
- @ host: press "invite user 1"
- Go on user 1 and wait for the connection to be finish.
- @ host: press "invite user 2"
- Go on user 2 and wait for the connection to be finish.
- Go on user 1 and accept the call.
- Go on user 2 and accept that call.

- Easy. 3 way connection done. Will be tweeking it a lot but
  at least it's done.
